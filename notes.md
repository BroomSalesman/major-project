Games to take inspiration from:
Baby Chicco Adventures - https://www.crazygames.com/game/baby-chicco-adventures


Lives:
Instead of dying upon any damage, have it so you can collect 2 or 3 hearts to make sure you can take multiple hits.

Traps:
Lasers coming down

Animations:
Jumping up animation

Movement:
If character moves fast, make him deaccelerate instead of going to deadstop

Way Later Stuff:
Create effects for landing on ground from a larger height
Little billboard that pops up as part of tutorial
Falling platforms
Dying animation like mario
Maybe skill tree (speed, jump height, a triple jump, higher jump after jumping on enemies, etc.)
