## Project Description
A Mr. Nickel the Science Pickel platformer game where he has to save Princess Pickel from the evil Schellenborg. It will include many of the same elements from Super Mario Bros, but have more of a Super Mario World feel to it in terms of how vibrant the art is. It will try to incorporate some minigames into it too instead of having multiple boss fights, but there will be one final boss fight. 

## Needs to have
- Mr. Nickel the Science Pickel
- Scrolling background
- Multiple Levels - at least 4
- Animations
- At least two types of mini games
- Some questions about biology (for revives maybe)
- At least one power up
- Traps

## Nice to have
- Pixelizing through code so I don't have to use already 8-bit images
- Integration with a controller
- Multiple levels - more than 4, maybe up to 10
- Powerups to give the character advantages
- If using powerups, have some parts of levels that can only be traversed by using those power ups. 
- Using a chunk system to save RAM. Only 3 chunks loaded at a time. X represents chunk character is in: | |X| |
- More than 2 mini games
- A companion like Yoshi
